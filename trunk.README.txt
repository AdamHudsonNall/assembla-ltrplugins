All source code proper is in the trunk, as recommended by Assembla/SVN.

Directories:

- Framework: framework modules.
- Hello(Gen-Rel)World: Example plugin, generated and released by PluginGenerator.
- PluginGenerator: a plugin that generates plugins, and prepares them for release.
- Templates: Working plugins based on the framework, whose files form the basis of plugins generated by PluginGenerator.
- Other: Non-framework based tools and code snippets, presently organized by author, but that could change...
